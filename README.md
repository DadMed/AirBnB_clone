# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description:
The AirBnB Clone project aims to create a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform. This involves implementing a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, creating classes for various entities (such as User, State, City, Place), and developing a file storage engine for serialization and deserialization.

## Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter is a tool that allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects through the command line. It supports functionalities such as creating new objects, retrieving objects from storage, performing operations on objects, and updating object attributes.

## How to Start:
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DadMed/AirBnB_clone.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AirBnB_clone
    ```
3. Run the command interpreter:
    ```bash
    ./console.py
    ```
